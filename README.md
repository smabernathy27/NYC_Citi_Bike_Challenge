# NYC_Citi_Bike_Challenge

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to review the data on the bike sharing app so we can determine the viability for expanding the service to Des Moines.

## Results

Going through the story in order:
- We start off with the number of rides for August which shows a total of 2,344,224.
- Then we look at the length of each ride. This grahpic shows that most rides are under 20 minutes and almost all are under an hour.
- Viz 3 shows when these rides were purchased during the week by hour and day through a heat map. Our busiest hours were during commuting times in the week and during the day on the weekends.
- Next we created a pie chart to show the amount and percentages of users by their gender. Majority of riders were male.
- Much like viz 2, viz 5 shows the length of each ride but filtered by the gender. Tells the same story that most rides are under 20 minutes and almost all are under an hour.
- The same idea was done for our next visulization. We used the heat map of rides by weekday per hour but filtered it between genders. Tells the same story that our busiest hours were during commuting times in the week and during the day on the weekends.
- Next we created a pie chart which showed wether the users were one-off purchasers or subsribers. Most of our users were subscribers.
- Our last visualization shows us a heat map filtered by usertype, then by gender and then by weekday. Our male subscribers were the most active on Thursdays and Fridays.

## Summary
These visualizations do give a good insight into how the bike sharing app worked in NYC. However, there are a couple more visualizations I would make to further our understanding. First is to try to determine an average length of ride in terms of distance. It would be interesting to compare that to our duration visualization. Lastly, I would also create a visualization that showed me the number of rides purchased by birth year and gender so we can better understand who our users are.
